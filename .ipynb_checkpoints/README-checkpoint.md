# NLP and Sentiment Analysis: TF-IDF vs Transformers
In this repo I have collected all the code developed to test the transformers approach vs tf-idf

I've developed some model for Sentiment Analysis. 

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Internet Movie Dataset (IMdb)**:
a collection of 50000 feedbacks divided in two categiories: 0= negative, 1=positive)

The dataset can be downloaded from here: 

http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

after the download it can be decompressed with this command:

tar -zxf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
